# Syncfusion Blazor Scheduler - AI-Powered Event Scheduling

## Overview

This demo showcases how AI can convert natural language text into structured scheduler events. This integration enhances user experience by seamlessly transforming casual text into meeting appointments, making scheduling more efficient and intuitive.

## Features

- **Natural Language Conversion**: Transforms casual text into structured scheduler events.
- **Smart Paste Integration**: Integrates with the Scheduler component to automate event creation from text.
- **Custom Dialog**: Allows users to review and finalize converted content before adding it to the Scheduler.

## How It Works

In this sample, the **Smart Paste Component** is integrated with the **Scheduler Component**. Users can input natural language text, which is then converted into structured events through the smart paste feature. The converted content is presented in a custom dialog for review and can be added directly to the Scheduler component, streamlining the event scheduling process.
